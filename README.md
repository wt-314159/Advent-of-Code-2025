# Advent of Code 2025
---

Taking part in the 2025 Advent of Code programming challenge, using Rust.
Puzzles can be found at <https://adventofcode.com/>.

The challenge is to solve the problems in as short a time as possible, so the code here isn't likely to be particularly neat, or the necessarily the most optimal solution.
